# IndoorObjectDetection

This repository demonstrates how to train an object detector using the dataset.

## Dataset

The [Indoor Object Detection Dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/2654485#.Y9FTiRXMJD9) by Adhikari and Bishwo contains images of indoor scenes with labeled objects. The dataset includes a total of 7 classes of objects and 2213 images.

## Requirements

Google Colab
TensorFlow 2.x
Python 3

## Results

The object detector is able to achieve good performance on the test set of the Indoor Object Detection Dataset. The model can be used for various indoor object detection applications.
